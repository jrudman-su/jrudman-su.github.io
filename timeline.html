                Sputnik 22 (USSR) launched for an intended Mars flyby. Although
                the rocket that launched the spacecraft had a fatal issue and
                the spacecraft was destroyed soon after it achieved Earth orbit.
                NASA's Mariner was the first to fly by Mars and sent 21 photos
                of the Red Planet back to Earth.

                NASA's Viking 1 and Viking 2 both arrived at the Red Planet in
                1976 sending their lander to the surface while the orbiter
                remained working above. The Viking program was the first

                NASA's Mars Observer launched to the planet on Sept. 25, 1992.
                The spacecraft was lost just before it was supposed to achieve
                Mars orbit on Aug. 21, 1993. This was a loss of an estimated
                $813 million.

                NASA's Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) left Earth in 1996, and
                arrived at Mars in 1997. Its mission was extended several times
                until NASA lost contact with it in 2006.

                NASA's Mars Odyssey launched in 2001 and successfully arrived at
                the Red Planet. The orbiter is still conducting its extended
                science mission. It broke the record for the longest-serving
                spacecraft at Mars in 2010.

                NASA's two rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, were sent to the
                surface of Mars in 2004. Each discovered ample evidence that
                water once flowed on the Red Planet.
              </li>
              <li>
                NASA launched a stationary lander called Mars Phoenix, which
                arrived at Mars in 2008, finding water ice beneath the surface.
              </li>
              <li>
                NASA's more powerful rover, called Curiosity, arrived at Gale
                Crater in 2012 to search for signs of habitable environments. It
                discovered previously water-soaked areas, deteced methane on the
                surface, and found organic compounds.
