              Although the Martian year is twice as long as Earth’s visitors
              would still experience winter and summer seasons because of the
              planet’s tilted axis. Mars rotates at almost exactly the same
              frequency as our planet thus making its days just 40 minutes
              longer than our own. Explorers would be indulged some mind-blowing
              sights, with vast canyons, giant mountains and sand dunes much
              like a desert. The sunrise and sunset would be blue creating a
              completly new perseption of reality.

            <p class="genre-text">
              The cold, coupled with a lack of oxygen, very low pressures and
              solar radiation would confine astronauts to their spacecraft or
              enclosed vehicles. This would limit the aboumt of walks in
              spacesuits. The first priorities for long term visitors would
              therefore be building some kind of shelter and setting up a power
              source through solar or nucular.

            <p class="genre-text">
              If we get serious about establishing a colony on Mars we would
              have to consider that we will want it to be as similar to Earth as
              possible. Currently, The atmosphere on Mars is extreme enough that
              if you were to pour a water on the surface it would either freeze,
              boil away, or do both at the same time. Some want to fix this by
              adding more carben dioxide to jump start it into being similar to
              earths atmosphere. This would mean that liquid water could be
              sustained on the Martian surface, possibly allowing plants to be
              grown, which in turn would increase oxygen levels.
